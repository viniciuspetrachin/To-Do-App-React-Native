# tasks app
Simple design To Do List React Native App.

Components used: FlatList, Text, View, Swipeable, TouchableOpacity, 
TouchableWithowFeedback, AsyncStorage, TextInput, StyleSheet, Modal, 
Platform, Moment, DateTimePicker, Vector Icons and more.

Methodologies learned: componentDidMount, Aync Await, AsyncStorage, functional component, class-based component and more.

The project was done without a backend, but throughout its development, the backend function will be added.
And option to navigate between screens using React Navigation.
To have options such as: Weekly, Monthly and Daily tasks.

The idea is that it is a good 'todo list' simple and easy to use and will be launched on the Playstore.
