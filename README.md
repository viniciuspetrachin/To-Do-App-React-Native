# tasks app / lista ai
Simple design To Do List React Native App.

Components used: `FlatList, Text, View, Swipeable, TouchableOpacity, TouchableWithowFeedback, AsyncStorage, TextInput, StyleSheet, Modal, Platform, Moment, DateTimePicker, React Native Vector Icons`

Methodologies learned: `componentDidMount, Async, Await, AsyncStorage, functional component, class-based component.`

The project was done without a backend, but throughout its development, the backend function will be added.
And option to navigate between screens using React Navigation.

To have options such as: Weekly, Monthly and Daily tasks.

The idea is that it is a good 'todo list' simple and easy to use and will be launched on the Playstore.
